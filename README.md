# Homeport

Homeport is a Dockerized Linux development environment. It's basically a Linux
shell account you can hack in where ever you're able to run Docker.

Homeport creates a home directory for you in a data volume. You can then build
different Homeport images and run a shell. From your shell you can edit your
home directory.

Currently, I'm able to build different images with different build tools, I'm
able to tag these images so I can visit my home directory armed with Node.js
with one image, or armed with Ruby with aother.

It's nifty way to do dependency management.

Future directions:

 * Exposing the home directory to the host operating system via Samba, so you
 can use the tools on your workstation.
 * Syncing the home directory using BitTorrent Sync.
 * Way to migrate home directories from one version of Ubuntu to the next. Some
 [notes on that score](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23137544/how-to-map-volume-paths-using-dockers-volumes-from), or else I could import and export using `tar`.

If you have suggestions, please place them in [milestone
discussion](https://github.com/bigeasy/homeport/issues/1).

## Details

Homeport is always the latest Ubuntu.

## Installation

To come:

 * Installation via Homebrew.
 * Installation via `curl | bash`.

For now, you can checkout the source code from the GitHub repository, and then
place a link to `./homeport` somewhere in your `PATH`.


## Creating an Image

Create an image with `homeport create`. Add packages with `homeport append`.

```console
$ homeport create
$ homeport append vim rsync zsh
$ homeport append git
```

The packages will be installed using `apt-get`. New images will be created.

```console
$ docker images | grep '\(REPOSITORY\|homeport\)'
REPOSITORY                       TAG          IMAGE ID       CREATED       VIRTUAL SIZE
bigeasy/homeport_shell-default   latest       4268a86a11d5   9 hours ago   459.8 MB
homeport_shell-default           alan         4268a86a11d5   9 hours ago   459.8 MB
bigeasy/homeport_shell-default   foundation   8d6e8de11c1c   9 hours ago   248.3 MB
```

In the above list, you can see that homeport has created a two images (I'm
getting rid of one of them.) One is the base image that was generated by
`homeport create`. The other is the latest image for generated by repeated
called to `homeport append`. The latest image is the one that is run when you
type `homeport run`.

## Running Your Image

For now, you need to first create a home direcotry.

```
$ homeport home
$ homeport run
```

You should drop into `bash`. (Broken, you have to fuss.)
